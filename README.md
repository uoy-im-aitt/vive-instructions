# Using the HTC Vive in the Immersive Technologies Lab

The following instructions explain how to get started with the HTC Vive in the School of Arts and Creative Technologies Immersive Technologies Lab (RCH/005). The instructions also apply to our smaller VR room in the TFTI building (TFTV/250D).

## Connecting your headset and controllers to your chosen PC. 

1. Make sure that you have the HTC Vive headset and controllers that correspond to the PC  you are working at. There is a small box on top of each of the VR PCs that you 
connect the headset to. On this box there is a sticker that identifies the correct headset  and controller to be used with this PC (e.g. “Vive02”). The headset and controllers that correspond with the PC you are using will have the same sticker on them.

2. Connect the HTC Vive headset to the computer you are using, by plugging the USB, HDMI and headphone connectors into the front of the small box on top of the PC.

## Configure and run SteamVR

1. Run the “Steam” Application. You should find a shortcut to this on the desktop.

2. Login to Steam using your personal Steam account.

3. Click the small ```VR``` icon at the top right of the Steam window and choose ```Launch Steam VR```

4. A new SteamVR window will open. Click on the menu in this window and choose ```Room Setup``` and follow the instructions (choosing Room Scale).

5. Test it works by running the tutorial, which is accesible by choosing ```Tutorial``` in the Steam VR menu.
